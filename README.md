- Keep the razor code in `.razor` file. (if backend code is minimal, it can be in the same file)
- Keep all the css in the `.css` file associated with the component. For eg: Login.razor will have css in Login.razor.css
- Avoid .js as far as possible. If it is still required, keep all the js in the `.js` file associated with the component. For eg: Login.razor will have js in Login.razor.js
- The objective is creating UI, hence avoid any implementation of event handlers and just provide the empty methods.
